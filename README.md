# Demo App with Nx, React, and Perspective

This is a demo project that shows how to integrate [Perspective](https://perspective.finos.org/) with [Nx](https://nx.dev) and use it in [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. Do not forget to add `--` between the command and the flag, if you are using npm.
